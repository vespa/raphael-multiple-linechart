# RaphaÃ«l Line Charts Plugin #

## TODO List ##


*   Allow setting popup=false, so that no hover function would be defined, thus
    making the lines1 and lines2 data attributes optional.
*   Test in IE, add "tested browsers" list to docs (so far success with Chrome, FF4, Mobile
    Safari).
*   Fix IE bug: getElementsByClassName undefined.
*   Allow liquid width/height (how?).
*   Reconsider setting drawGrid and popup as Raphael plugins.
*   X, Y axis ticks near labels
