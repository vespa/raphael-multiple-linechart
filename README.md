# RaphaÃ«l Multiple Line Charts Plugin #

This plugin fixes the line scale problem: now, the height and width of them are oriented by the highest value found. Also, you don't need to configure the color of the lines anymore, the javascript will calculate the new color when more data added. You can put how many data-tables you want, just tell to the script who are they adding "data-chart" on table's attributes.

There's a diference between the tables used by the parent code and this one: this plugin eliminated one TR from the table because the data was redundant

All older features	are still availible.
